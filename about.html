          <h4>
            A respectable joint since 1998
          </h4>

          <p> 
            The New Amsterdam Cafe has been loving and promoting cannabis since the beginning. 
            With the establishment of the cafe in 1998, we have twenty years of experience providing 
            and promoting a cannabis-friendly culture. The New Amsterdam Cafe has been a safe haven 
            for smoking cannabis during a time of stigma and uncertainty. We have had the amazing 
            opportunity to witness firsthand how cannabis has gradually become accepted in both a 
            social and legal realm throughout the years. The world can look to us for an example of 
            cannabis consumption in daily lives and society, and how it impacts communities. We are 
            willing and want to be the brain trust of the modern cannabis movement.
            
          </p>
          <p>

            The New Amsterdam Cafe is the coolest cannabis consumption lounge in North America. 
            Cannabis lovers from all across the continent pilgrimage north to the OG spot that started it all.
